# ✅ Java Compilation Error Fixed - Final Success

## 🎯 **Issue Resolved**

The Java compilation error has been successfully fixed:

```
java: class AdminUserService is public, should be declared in a file named AdminUserService.java
```

## 🔧 **Root Cause**

Java requires that public class names must match the filename. When I renamed the class from `UserService` to `AdminUserService`, the filename was still `UserService.java`, causing the compilation error.

## 🛠️ **Final Fix Applied**

### **1. Deleted Old File**
- **Removed**: `catering-system/src/main/java/com/example/catering_system/admin/service/UserService.java`
- **Reason**: File contained old `UserService` class that was renamed

### **2. Verified New File**
- **Confirmed**: `AdminUserService.java` exists with correct content
- **Class Name**: `public class AdminUserService`
- **Bean Name**: `@Service("adminUserService")`

### **3. Successful Compilation**
```bash
